# Twitter-social-analysis

In this project, we collected tweets using Twitter's REST API. 
Then we applied a variety of methods in order to process that data.
The goal of this project was to produce similarity graphs between links, hashtags, mentions.
In the end, those graphs are analyzed and evaluated.
