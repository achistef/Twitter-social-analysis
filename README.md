# Twitter-social-analysis

In this project, we collected tweets during the 2016 US elections, using Twitter's REST API. 
Then we applied a variety of methods in order to process that data.
The goal of this project was to produce similarity graphs between links, hashtags and mentions using Gephi.
In the end, those graphs are analyzed and evaluated.
